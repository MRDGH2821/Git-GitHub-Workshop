# Creating a Repository Using GitHub Desktop

After you Sign in to GitHub Desktop you will see this screen.

![GD Repo Screen](Assets/Gd_Repo_Screen.png)<br>

Lets create a new Repository.<br>
Click on the 2nd option.<br>
`Create a New Repository on your hard drive`<br>

Enter the name, a brief description and done!
You may also want to change the "Local path"

### Using Existing Repository instead of creating New

Suppose You created a repo in GitHub already. And you want to use that one.
<br>Open the repo online & do the following - <br><br>
![Cloning Existing Repository](Assets/Cloning_Repo_Into_Gd.png)<br><Br>
Click on `Open with GitHub Desktop`
<br>

##### Or<br>

You can add existing local repo by clicking on `Add an existing Repository from hard drive`<br><br>

![GD Repo Screen](Assets/Gd_Repo_Screen.png)<br>

#### Adding files & other stuff

Now, open the repo using this button -<br>
`Show in Explorer`<br><br>
![Opening Repo Locally](Assets/Opening_Repo_locally.png)<br><br>

Copy your files into the repo "folder"<br>
GitHub Desktop will automatically detect the changes you made.<br>
In my case I will add a demo text file.<br><br>

![After adding files in repo](Assets/Adding_Files_in_Gd.png)
<br><br>
Write a meaningful summary in the small text box just above Description. And add description too. Then Commit to master!<br>
(Or whatever branch you are in)

#### Publishing the Repository

_If you created the repo locally_<br><br>
After copying all the files, its time to Publish your repo to GitHub!

<br><br>
You may want to keep this settings while publishing the repo.<br><br>

#### Pushing to the Repository

_If you cloned the repo, or made changes after publishing repo_<br><br>

Instead of `Publish Repository` you will see `Push Origin` button.<br> Click on it and all the commits are now being pushed to Remote Repository!<br><br>
