### Using Existing Repository instead of creating New

Suppose You created a repo in GitHub already. And you want to use that one.
<br>Open the repo online & do the following - <br><br>

<br>

##### Or<br>

You can add existing local repo by clicking on `Add an existing Repository from hard drive`<br><br>

#### Adding files & other stuff

Now, open the repo using this button -<br>
`Show in Explorer`<br><br>
![Opening Repo Locally](https://i.imgur.com/oGmzcVw.png)<br><br>

Copy your files into the repo "folder"<br>
GitHub Desktop will automatically detect the changes you made.<br>
In my case I will add a demo text file.<br><br>

<br><br>
Write a meaningful summary in the small text box just above Description. And add description too. Then Commit to master!<br>
(Or whatever branch you are in)

#### Publishing the Repository

_If you created the repo locally_<br><br>
After copying all the files, its time to Publish your repo to GitHub!

#### Pushing to the Repository

_If you cloned the repo, or made changes after publishing repo_<br><br>

Instead of `Publish Repository` you will see `Push Origin` button.<br> Click on it and all the commits are now being pushed to Remote Repository!<br><br>
