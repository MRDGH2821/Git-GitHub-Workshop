# Creating Repository

You may use any of the following method to Create a repo & add files in it.

1.  [Using GitHub Desktop](/Creating%20Repo/Using%20GitHub%20Desktop.md)
2.  [Using Web](Creating%20Repo/Using%20Website%20(works%20on%20mobile%20also).md)
3.  [Using Git Bash](/Creating%20Repo/Using%20Git%20Bash.md>)

The 2nd method works on mobile also. On top of that it doesn't require you to install any app.
