# Creating a Repository Using GitHub Desktop

After you Sign in to GitHub Desktop you will see this screen.

![GD Repo Screen](/Assets/GD%20Repo%20Screen.png)<br>

Lets create a new Repository.<br>
Click on the 2nd option.<br>
`Create a New Repository on your hard drive`<br>

Enter the name, a brief description and done!
You may also want to change the "Local path"

### Using Existing Repository instead of creating New

Suppose You created a repo in GitHub already. And you want to use that one.
<br>Open the repo online & do the following - <br><br>
![Cloning Existing Repository](/Assets/Cloning%20Repo%20into%20GD.png)<br><Br>
Click on `Open with GitHub Desktop`

#### Adding files & other stuff

Now, open the repo using this button -<br>
`Show in Explorer`<br><br>
![Opening Repo Locally](/Assets/Opening%20Repo%20locally.png)<br><br>

Copy your files into the repo "folder"<br>
GitHub Desktop will automatically detect the changes you made.<br>
In my case I will add a demo text file.<br><br>

![After adding files in repo](/Assets/Adding%20Files%20in%20GD.png)
<br><br>
Write a meaningful summary in the small text box just above Description. And add description too. Then Commit to master!<br>
(Or whatever branch you are in)

#### Publishing the Repository

_If you created the repo locally_<br><br>
After copying all the files, its time to Publish your repo to GitHub!

You may want to keep this settings while publishing the repo.<br><br>

#### Pushing to the Repository

_If you cloned the repo, or made changes after publishing repo_<br><br>

Instead of `Publish Repository` you will see `Push Origin` button.<br> Click on it and all the commits are now being pushed to Remote Repository!<br><br>
