# Creating a Repository Using GitHub Desktop

After you Sign in to GitHub Desktop you will see this screen.

Lets create a new Repository.<br>
Click on the 2nd option.<br>
`Create a New Repository on your hard drive`<br>

Enter the name, a brief description and done!
You may also want to change the "Local path"

#### Adding files & other stuff

Now, open the repo using this button -<br>
`Show in Explorer`<br><br>
![Opening Repo Locally](/Assets/Opening%20Repo%20locally.png)<br><br>

Copy your files into the repo "folder"<br>
GitHub Desktop will automatically detect the changes you made.<br>
In my case I will add a demo text file.<br><br>

<br><br>
Write a meaningful summary in the small text box just above Description. And add description too. Then Commit to master!<br>
(Or whatever branch you are in)

#### Publishing Repository

After copying all the files, its time to Publish your repo to GitHub!
